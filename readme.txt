* "Chuang, H.C., Hsu, P.H., Kuan, C.M., Yang, J.C., 2022. Reexamining Firm Fixed Effects Models with Machine Learning: The Missing R&D-Patent Relation. Available at SSRN."
*
* In this set of code, we demonstrate how users can implement the following four ways for the potential bias from fixed effects regressions: 
*  (1) Within Between Variation: check if within-firm variation dominates between-firm variation or vice versa 
*  (2) Regression without firm FEs
*  (3) Hausman_Taylor_Estimates
*  (4) Post-regularization and DML LASSO methods (note that you may need to use STATA v17)

Data and Code Availability:
* We have prepared the following documents:
- "Replicate_code_MissingRDPatent_ML.do" contains the STATA code that produces all our results in the paper;
- "Replicate_data_MissingRDPatent_ML.dta" contains the dataset (in STATA format) of the randomly selected 200 firms from our full sample.
- "Replicate_log_MissingRDPatent_ML.sml" contains the log file for running the "Replicate_code_MissingRDPatent_ML.do" on "Replicate_data_MissingRDPatent_ML.dta".


Sample Data Construction
* We randomly pick up 200 firms from our sample in this replicate exercise. PERMCO here is a pseudo firm identifier for illustration purposes.
* Variables definitions are as follows, and interested readers are referred to our paper and the original data sources to collect them.
- patent:     Number of patent (data from USPTO PatentsView)
- lnnpatent:  The logarithm of one plus the number of patents (data from USPTO PatentsView)
- RDAT:       Research and development (R&D) expenses scaled by the total asset (data from Compustat)
- lnME:       The logarithm of market equity (data from CRSP)
- RD_missing: A binary variable indicating that R&D expenses are missing (data from Compustat)
- lnAge:      The logarithm of years where a firm exists in Compustat (data from Compustat)
- lnK2L:      The logarithm of net property, plant, and equipment divided by the number of employees(data from Compustat)
- TobinQ:      The market value of a firm divided by its replacement cost (data from Compustat and CRSP)
- ROA:        Return on assets (data from Compustat)
- Leverage:   Long-term debt plus current debt, divided by total assets (data from Compustat)
- CASH AT:    Cash to the total asset  (data from Compustat)
- KZidx:      The financial constrain index (data from Compustat)
- Instown:    The total institutional ownership from 13f filings divided by the total number of shares outstanding (data from CRSP and Thomson/Refinitiv)
- oms_HHidx:  One minus the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) based on three-digit industry classification (data from Compustat)
- oms_HHidx_square: Square of oms_HHidx (data from Compustat)


Results for Sample Data:
* Depends on computer capacity; we also provide results using the sample data.
- "Within_Between_Variation.smcl" contains the log file for running the Between and Within variations of the key variables. 
- "Fixed_Effects_Linear_Model_Estimates.csv" contains the results of the estimation for OLS with and without FEs.
- "Hausman_Taylor_Estimates.csv" contains the results of the estimation for Hausman and Taylor estimation.
- "Post_Regulization_LASSO_Linear_Model_Estimates.csv" contains the results of the estimation for the Post-regularization LASSO linear model.	
- "DML_LASSO_Linear_Model_Estimates.csv" contains the results of the estimation for the double machine learning (DML) LASSO linear model.	
- "Fixed_Effects_Poisson_Model_Estimates.csv" contains the results of the estimation for the Poisson model with and without FEs.
- "Post_Regulization_LASSO_Poisson_Model_Estimates.csv" contains the results of the estimation for the Post-regularization LASSO Poisson model.		
- "DML_LASSO_Poisson_Model_Estimates.csv" contains the results of the estimation for DML LASSO Poisson model.	


* The following commands may need to be installed on STATA to run the codes in "Replicate_code_MissingRDPatent_ML.do" 
- reghdfe 
- ppmlhdfe
- esttab


* The STATA version to fully run the "Replicate_log_MissingRDPatent_ML.do":
  Version 17.0/MP—Parallel Edition
- The LASSO inference approaces: `poregress', `xporegress', `popoisson', and `xpopoisson' are available since STATA 16.
  The cluster standard error for those methods are only available since STATA 17. 
  You can still use the robust standard error for those methods.
